<h2 is-upgraded>Postman Public Workspace</h2>
<p>Your Postman public workspace is the home for all of your work. Here you can share all of your other workspaces, links and important collections to give others in the community a chance to see your work.</p>
<p><strong>New to public workspaces?<br></strong><a href="https://blog.postman.com/how-to-set-up-public-workspaces/" target="_blank">How to Set Up Your First Public Workspace in 5 Easy Steps</a> blog post, <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/public-workspaces/" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>When to Create a Public Workspace</h3>
<p>Public workspaces are a valuable tool to assist in making polished presentations. You can use a workspace for all of your talks and public work. <br></p>
<p><strong>Examples:<br></strong> - If you&#39;re consistently speaking/publishing about mocks, you could have a specific public workspace for everything mocking related. <br> - When you find an API you&#39;re particularly excited about, make an API, or want a dedicated space for a project, those could be separate public workspaces. <br> - If you have a passion project or something topical.</p>
